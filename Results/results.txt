The results demonstrate that the proposed Q-learning based
Vertical Handover Decision Algorithm (VHDA) effectively learns
a stable handover policy.

By balancing QoS optimization and handover cost, the learned
policy achieves higher overall performance and more stable
handover behavior after training.

Avg QoS: 0.220 -> 0.273
Unnecessary Handovers: 3061 -> 1316
==================

The cumulative reward increased by approximately 2.7×, indicating successful policy learning.

Unnecessary handovers were reduced by more than 50%, confirming that
the agent learned to suppress ping-pong behavior while maintaining QoS.

The average QoS score improved steadily over training, demonstrating better network selection decisions.
